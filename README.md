# Tampermonkey Scripts Collection

This repository is a collection of Tampermonkey scripts for my personal use. Each script is a JavaScript file located in the root of this repository. Below is the documentation for each script.

### google-interface-cleanup-fixed.js

**Original Source**

[Google interface cleanup](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/504171-google-interface-cleanup).

**Description:**  
This script removes various unwanted elements from Google search results to provide a cleaner interface. It targets and hides elements such as "People also ask", "Videos", "Related searches", and many more. The script uses XPath to identify and remove these elements. It also includes functionality to hide or remove specific elements, traverse ancestor nodes to find and hide parent elements, and remove search suggestions. This is a fixed version of the original with minor edits added for personal preference. Also pretty formatting.
